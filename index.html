            TimerApp (alias tinyTimer)
          </h1>

          <p>Very simple Timer app for counting down a set number of minutes/seconds.</p>

<p>TimerApp v1.0 by JammerB (c) 2011</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010</li>
  <li>Written in VB .NET</li>
</ul>

<p>The app opens a small Windows form with two separate controls respectively for minutes and seconds input.
Once these are set, the user presses the Start button and the countdown starts. 
There is a Stop button in case there is no need to wait the full amount of time. 
Another press of the Stop button resets the 'Minutes' and 'Seconds' controls.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when the countdown ends - a dialog box pops up to inform the user about it.</p>

<p>While the timer is counting, users can use their PCs as normal - the app gets hidden behind other programs. 
When the time reaches zero: a dialog pops up on top of all other windows.</p>

<p>The tricky part is that while the countdown is progressing the app window behaves as normal, when 
it ends - the window is displayed on top of all other programs (i.e. option 'Always on top' is set to True).</p>

<p>The purpose was to count the time between free donwloads for share sites like rapidshare.com, uploaded.com, etc.
So in example after downloading one file for free - you have to wait 15 minutes before the next download. 
Dial in 15 minutes in the app and go on doing your business - the app will pop up to inform you as soon as 
the time has passed. </p>

<p>This saved me a lot of time back in the days cause I'd usually get distracted andonly remember to start 
the next download in like 30-60 minutes later. With this app I was able to keep the losses to a minimum :)</p>
